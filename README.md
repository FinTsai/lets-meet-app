## Problem Statement:
This app is for people looking for coffee buddies. It is for people to meet a stranger who is available nearby for a coffee now. The user may want to meet people that come from different countries and share information together. However, for foreigners it may be difficult to know good cafes in the area.

## Resolution:
To create an app that enables someone to meet new friends and doing same thing together now. The host of the event can pick a location nearby and invite other users to join.
